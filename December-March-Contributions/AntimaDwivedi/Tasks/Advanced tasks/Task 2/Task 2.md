# Task 2: Design of an app for the project 

## <b>Introduction of the problem statement</b><br> 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year.Identifying causes of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.The ultimate goal of this project is to come up with a complete app for pulse rate for wide and easy adoption at very low cost.

## <b>Proposed Solution</b><br>
<b>•</b>The basic idea is to develop an application(android) and use the features of a mobile phone for computation and reducing human power.<br>
<b>•</b> Pulse rate  will be tested in two phases.The first will be a basic testing by humans itself and the other one will be to record pulse rate of heart and consult with doctor remotely.
<br>
## Let us go through the app design simultanously.<br>

<b>•</b> After connectiong the stethoscope with mobile phone ,Patient will open the application on mobile phone.<br><br>

<b>•</b> Home page of Android application will look like the below image<br><br>

<b>•</b> User can click on the <b>START </b> button to monitor the heart sounds in Home Page.<br><br>
<b>•</b> There will be two options on the UI ,first is Live testing and other is recording of the heart beats.<br>

<b>•</b> Tensorflow model for<b> Sound Classification</b> deployed on the backend will detect the disease and show output on the screen.<br><br>
<b>•</b> Patient can also record and send it to the doctor for the consultant.<br><br>

<b>•</b>  Appointment with doctor can also be scheduled via online for better treatment.<br><br>

<b>•</b> Video calls with doctor.<br><br>

<b>•</b>  At last,User can also send feedbacks about the doctor.<br><br>



## Improvement in the app design.<br>
After further modification and improvement,Application UI will be look like this.
